# Sales Analysis
## Overview
In this project, I created a sales report by using Power BI. The main idea of this project was to present the sales information.

## Resources
To create the data sample, I used Python to generate random values. The final datasets were in the resources folder.
- [sales info](https://github.com/Kun-kz/Sales_Analysis/blob/main/resources/summary.csv)
- [agents info](https://github.com/Kun-kz/Sales_Analysis/blob/main/resources/sales.csv)
- [month index](https://github.com/Kun-kz/Sales_Analysis/blob/main/resources/month_index.csv)

## Summary
In this project, I created a dashboard to present the sales information. Data was broken down by time, agent, and region. It helped us to discover additional details in the data.
